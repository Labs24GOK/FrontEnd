Easy-to-use, ‘cloud application’ that promotes school’s quality education at an affordable price, enables parents to register their children for classes, schedule a placement test (or have a student to take a placement test online), pay tuition, and track their childrens’ success at school.       


### Key Features

-    Create Students View
-    Add/View/Update Student Record
-    Add/View/Update Staff Records
-    Add/View/Update Courses
-    Online Student Registration/Course Enrollment
-    Record Student Attendance
-    Online Placement Test Taking & Grading


## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### Front end framework is React
-    familiarity is one the biggest advantage using React, everyone can start coding right day one.
-    a popular js library that is fast, scalable, simple, and maintained by a lot of developers.
-    We also are likely to have a need to reuse modular units of code (due to student info) that will appear in our various routes/views.
-    We also want something that is performant and easy to maintain/extend. 


## Styled Components - an add-on for creating dynamic styles directly in React components.
- Use Case: Having a base library implemented for overall site styling will cover most use cases, but we may need more flexibility on a per-component basis and the ability to add/alter styles dynamically based user interaction/the state of the application, and Styled Components can provide this.
- Pros: easy to use, easy to create, can make them custom

## Ant Design - an add-on for styles for forms in React components.
- Use Case: Needed consistent styling for forms used throughout the application that was more flexible and easier to achieve than with Styled Components
- Pros: made it easy to implement and design multi-step form layout

#### Front end deployed to AWS Amplify

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/speak-out-be) built using:

-   Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
-   Node.js allows the team to build platform-independent web apps.
-   Popular, easy to use, and allows us to write JS on the backend, access to NPM packages
-   Express is a web server application designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
-   On Top of Node.js it allows the team to make a REST API to make a web server and it allows flexibility through the routes api that express provides.
-   It's highly flexible for all different kinds of API requirements, supports middleware which are easy to create, and a huge number of packages available on NPM.

List the rest of the back end end features and libraries in the same format as the framework above
## PostgreSQL - also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database 
- Using postgresql will help us link up data to one another which will help us identify data uniquely.
- Popular, well-supported, well-documented and has a free tier for developing environments.


## JSON Web Tokens - JWT - A extremely flexible and modular authentication middleware for express.
- JWT will give us a way to handle authentication in different strategies based on the stakeholders needs.
- JWT is a well documented authentication library and works very well with node and express


# Installation Instructions

```npm install``` within the client directory

## Other Scripts

    * coverage - runs testing coverage report
    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
