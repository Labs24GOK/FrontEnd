Easy-to-use, ‘cloud application’ that promotes school’s quality education at an affordable price, enables parents to register their children for classes, schedule a placement test (or have a student to take a placement test online), pay tuition, and track their childrens’ success at school.       


### 4️⃣ Key Features

-    feature one
-    feature two
-    feature three
-    feature four
-    feature five

## 1️⃣ Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### _Front end framework is React
-    familiarity is one the biggest advantage using React, everyone can start coding right day one.
-    a popular js library that is fast, scalable, simple, and maintained by a lot of developers.
-    We also are likely to have a need to reuse modular units of code (due to student info) that will appear in our various routes/views.
-  We also want something that is performant and easy to maintain/extend. 


List the rest of the front end features and libraries in the same format as the framework above.
## Material UI - a UI framework that works well with React.
-  For primary styling of the site. Given the number of developers who may work on the app, there could be difficulty achieving stylistic uniformity across all views (the "too many cooks in the kitchen" issue). Material UI would allow for a clean and consistent user interface, and save time, since it is implemented in a standard way regardless of who is using it.
- Pros: Reusable, prebuilt components save time
## Styled Components - an add-on for creating dynamic styles directly in React components.
- Use Case: Having a base library implemented for overall site styling will cover most use cases, but we may need more flexibility on a per-component basis and the ability to add/alter styles dynamically based user interaction/the state of the application, and Styled Components can provide this.
- Pros: easy to use, easy to create, can make them custom



#### Front end deployed to `🚫insert service here`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/speak-out-be) built using:

####  back end framework are Node JS and Express

-   Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
-   Node.js allows the team to build platform-independent web apps.
-   Popular, easy to use, and allows us to write JS on the backend, access to NPM packages
-  Express is a web server application designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
-  On Top of Node.js it allows the team to make a REST API to make a web server and it allows flexibility through the routes api that express provides.
-  It's highly flexible for all different kinds of API requirements, supports middleware which are easy to create, and a huge number of packages available on NPM.

List the rest of the back end end features and libraries in the same format as the framework above
## PostgreSQL - also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database 
- Using postgresql will help us link up data to one another which will help us identify data uniquely.
- Popular, well-supported, well-documented and has a free tier for developing environments.

## SQLite3 (For Local Testing) - SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a C library.
- Sqlite3 will help us make a local database to make testing easier.

## Passport JS - A extremely flexible and modular authentication middleware for express.
- PassportJS will give us a way to handle authentication in different strategies based on the stakeholders needs.
- Passport is a well documented authentication library and works very well with node and express



# APIs

## 2️⃣ Authentication API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 2️⃣ Payment API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

# 3️⃣ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

🚫These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_plan - this is the ID for a second Stripe subscription plan, generated under Stripe products

# 5️⃣ Content Licenses

🚫For all content - images, icons, etc, use this table to document permission of use. Remove the two placeholders and add you content to this table

| Image Filename | Source / Creator | License                                                                      |

# 4️⃣ Testing

🚫Document what you used for testing and why

# 4️⃣ Installation Instructions

🚫explain how to install the required dependencies to get this project up and running with yarn and NPM

## Other Scripts

🚫replace these examples with your own

    * typecheck - runs the TypeScript compiler
    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
